# SunsetHills

Sunset Hills is an array manipulation challenge: the sun is setting in the West, and from West to East the heights of each
building is given in an integer array. Which of the buildings can see the sunset?

This challenge or a slight variation has been used by technology companies such as Amazon and was also
featured on a Geeks for Geeks blog post titled “Amazon Interview Experience | Set 189 (For SDE-1)”

This project was created using Bootstrap 4.5, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
All logic & JavaScript DOM changes were custom coded for this project.
